# Calculating Grades
# Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades, return an average test score, a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

# Average	Grade
# 90+	A
# 80-89	B
# 70-79	C
# 60-69	D
# 0-59	F

# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student is failing.
